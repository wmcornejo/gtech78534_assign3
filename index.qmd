# Addressing Health Concerns to NYC Officials

In past public health crises, visuals have proven to be one of the most effective ways to communicate data efficiently. A prime example is **Florence Nightingale's work during the Crimean War**. She used her famous "Coxcomb" diagram to visually represent the causes of soldier mortality, highlighting that the majority of deaths were due to preventable infections rather than battlefield injuries. Her work led to significant improvements in sanitation and medical care, drastically reducing death rates (Source: [Nightingale, 1858](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2684058/)).

Today, in an era of rapid urbanization and global connectivity, **web maps** should be the primary medium for sharing information about health hazards in cities. By leveraging geographic information systems (GIS), we can provide real-time, actionable insights to policymakers, healthcare providers, and the public.

This project serves as a call to action for NYC officials, emphasizing the critical role that **map data** can play in addressing public health emergencies like the COVID-19 pandemic. Through interactive maps and data visualizations, we can better understand the spread of diseases, allocate resources efficiently, and protect vulnerable communities.

## Why This Matters

The COVID-19 pandemic exposed critical gaps in how public health data is collected, analyzed, and communicated. By adopting **web-based GIS tools**, NYC can:

- **Identify hotspots**: Quickly pinpoint areas with high infection rates.
- **Allocate resources**: Ensure hospitals, testing sites, and vaccines reach the communities that need them most.
- **Engage the public**: Provide transparent, accessible information to build trust and encourage compliance with health guidelines.

This project demonstrates how GIS can transform raw data into actionable insights, empowering decision-makers to respond more effectively to future health crises.
