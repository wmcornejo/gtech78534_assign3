    "text": "In past public health crises, visuals have proven to be one of the most effective ways to communicate data efficiently. A prime example is Florence Nightingale’s work during the Crimean War. She used her famous “Coxcomb” diagram to visually represent the causes of soldier mortality, highlighting that the majority of deaths were due to preventable infections rather than battlefield injuries. Her work led to significant improvements in sanitation and medical care, drastically reducing death rates (Source: Nightingale, 1858).\nToday, in an era of rapid urbanization and global connectivity, web maps should be the primary medium for sharing information about health hazards in cities. By leveraging geographic information systems (GIS), we can provide real-time, actionable insights to policymakers, healthcare providers, and the public.\nThis project serves as a call to action for NYC officials, emphasizing the critical role that map data can play in addressing public health emergencies like the COVID-19 pandemic. Through interactive maps and data visualizations, we can better understand the spread of diseases, allocate resources efficiently, and protect vulnerable communities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplore the interactive map to visualize COVID-19 data across New York City.\nView Map\n\n\n\nSee the datasets used in this project and how they were analyzed.\nView Data\n\n\n\nRead and sign the open letter to the mayor, addressing key concerns and recommendations for improving public health data communication.\nRead and Sign Letter\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic exposed critical gaps in how public health data is collected, analyzed, and communicated. By adopting web-based GIS tools, NYC can:\n\nIdentify hotspots: Quickly pinpoint areas with high infection rates.\nAllocate resources: Ensure hospitals, testing sites, and vaccines reach the communities that need them most.\nEngage the public: Provide transparent, accessible information to build trust and encourage compliance with health guidelines.\n\nThis project demonstrates how GIS can transform raw data into actionable insights, empowering decision-makers to respond more effectively to future health crises.\n\n\n\n\nThis project was created as part of GTECH 78534: WebGIS to address COVID-19 concerns in New York City. It combines data analysis, interactive mapping, and public advocacy to highlight the importance of GIS in public health.\nFor more information, contact Your Name.\n\n\n\n\nNightingale, F. (1858).

    "text": "I am writing this letter to express the concerns that arose in New York City during the early stages of the Global COVID-19 pandemic and how important a role GIS can play in emergency response. Although 5 years after the outbreak, It remains important to fully understand and process past events in order to develop a plan for addressing similar crises in the future.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic in its early stages hit the world hard. As the virus spread rapidly, cities like New York, Milan, and Wuhan became epicenters of the crisis, experiencing an exponential rise in cases that strained resources and left governments scrambling to respond. These hotspots saw hospitals overwhelmed with patients, critical shortages of medical supplies, and the urgent need for coordinated responses at local, national, and international levels. The speed with which the virus spread exposed vulnerabilities in public health infrastructure, while also highlighting the importance of timely, data-driven decision-making to mitigate its effects.\n\nPlot.plot({\n  width:5000,\n  height: 120,\n  marks: [\n    Plot.text([\" The US in particular, in April of 2020, became the top global hotspot having more than 500,000 confirmed cases by that point (CDC).\"], {frameAnchor: \"middle\", fill: 'red', fontSize: 120 })\n  ]\n})\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above visual only shows COVID-19 in New York State, not in just NYC which was considered the global hotspot at one point. In order to better manage a crisis as such, GIS could have been implemented more to visualize the spread of the virus. More specifically, it’s crucial to look at the number of positive cases by MODZCTA (something similar to zipcodes). The below ArcGIS dashboard effectively communicated the areas that were most affected.\nIt is imperative that moving forward the city learns from these hardships and creates a more resilient and equitable response framework. GIS can be used to:\n\nStrengthen medical facilities by identifying areas in need of additional resources and ensuring hospitals are better equipped and prepared for future large-scale emergencies.\nImprove communication during public health crises, providing residents with timely, accurate, and location-specific information about safety protocols and resource availability.\nMap and prioritize the needs of the most vulnerable communities, ensuring that resources and support are directed where they are needed most during times of crisis.\nFacilitate collaboration with community leaders and organizations, ensuring that response strategies reflect the unique needs of neighborhoods, with data-driven input at every level of the decision-making process.\n\nAs we continue to navigate the aftermath of the pandemic, we must decisive actions to ensure New York City is better equipped to handle future emergencies. Together, we can create a more resilient, inclusive, and prepared city for all of its residents.\nSincerely,\n\n{strName}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nviewof strName = Inputs.text({label: \"Enter Name Here: \"})"
