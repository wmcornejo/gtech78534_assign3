## Visualizing Public Health Crises

### Mapping the Spread of COVID-19

The image below is a **COVID-19 global map** created by the World Health Organization (WHO). It illustrates the spread of the virus during the early stages of the pandemic. Maps like this were critical for understanding how the virus moved across borders and identifying hotspots where resources were needed most.
